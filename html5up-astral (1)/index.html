									<h2>About me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi, I'm Arjun Mann and welcome to my website! I was born in Bellevue, Washington and graduated from Redmond 
									High School in 2023. I'm double majoring in both Computer Science and Business Information Management Systems at UC Irvine.
									Over the past few years I've built websites, games, and am currently specializing in Artificial
									Intelligence Systems. I have a strong passion for programming, problem solving, and helping others.<br><br>

									I like reading. My go to genre is programming. My all time favorite is a tie
									between "Amusing Ourselves to Death" by Neil Postman, and "Algorithms to Live By" by Brian Christian. I've recently been on a hot streak of Brian Kernighan books. 
									Other hobbies I have include playing golf with my parents, hosting board game nights, and listening to Lex Fridman podcasts.

								<section>
								<h3>Metric Analytics • Software Engineer Intern <span class="small">(Jun 2025 – present)</span></h3>
								<p>
									• Developed an in-house standard RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) model for scoring AI generated image content using HuggingFace transformers, replacing expensive API calls and cutting inference spend by about 60%.
• Reduced average model response time from 7 to 4 seconds through query parallelization, improving data security and increasing videos scored per shift by about 30%. 
• Ran controlled environment experiments to understand tradeoffs across 10+ parameters (ex: temperature, top-p, model sizes, etc.), establishing baseline metrics for the new model I created.

								<h3>Lumber • Software Engineer Intern <span class="small">(Summer 2024)</span></h3>
								<p>
									• Developed a scraping application to streamline 300+ projects for an LLM, using Selenium to automatically log and return JSON data for account information, fully automating a manual process. 
• Generated timesheet data for 1000+ employees for a CRM, using Playwright and Beautiful Soup to convert internal data (i.e. time, employee information) into a universal CSV format.
• Cut customer onboarding costs (2 hrs of labor per customer) by building an automated pipeline that scrapes PDFs (PyMuPDF, Tabula API) for payroll information and loads the results into folders using Google Drive API.

									<h3>Goober Search</h3>
									<a href="https://github.com/your-repo" class="image fit">
									<img src="images/project-01.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Smart Garden Monitor">
									</a>
									<p>
										I’m proud of Goober, a hobby search engine I built with a team of four and now host on Vercel. We wrote an offline Python pipeline that crawls and fingerprint‑hashes content with SimHash to de‑duplicate 40 k+ public‑domain documents, then stores dense vector representations of documents in a index for sub 300  ms vector search.  Queries hit an API that fuses the vector scores with a ranker algorithm and returns results through a stylized React front end.  I learned a lot from my peers, who were all a year above me and taught me collaboration and development practices. Designing incremental reindexing and cache functions was my first taste of real‑world retrieval at scale, and the lessons, especially proximity vectorization, fed directly into the RAG pipeline I later shipped at Metric Analytics.
